java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, \n\
and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. it is \n\
intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (wora), meaning that \n\
code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. java \n\
applications are typically compiled to bytecode (class file) that can run on any java \n\
virtual machine (jvm) regardless of computer architecture. java is, as of 2012, one of \n\
the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web \n\
applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[10][11] java was originally developed \n\
by james gosling at sun microsystems (which has since merged into oracle corporation) and \n\
released in 1995 as a core component of sun microsystems' java platform. the language \n\
derives much of its syntax from c and c++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than \n\
either of them.

getHelpTest=Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...\n\
Search for PATTERN in each FILE or standard input.\n\
PATTERN is, by default, a basic regular expression (BRE).\n\
\n\
Output control:\n\
-v, --invert-match        select non-matching lines\n\
-o, --only-matching       show only the part of a line matching PATTERN\n\
-c, --count               print only a count of matching lines per FILE\n\
\n\
Context control:\n\
-B, --before-context=NUM  print NUM lines of leading context\n\
-A, --after-context=NUM   print NUM lines of trailing context\n\
-C, --context=NUM         print NUM lines of output context\

getPasteHelpTest=8.2 `paste': Merge lines of files\n\
=================================\n\
\n\
`paste' writes to standard output lines consisting of sequentially\n\
corresponding lines of each given file, separated by a TAB character.\n\
Standard input is used for a file name of `-' or if no input files are\n\
given.\n\
\n\
   For example:\n\
\n\
     $ cat num2\n\
     1\n\
     2\n\
     $ cat let3\n\
     a\n\
     b\n\
     c\n\
     $ paste num2 let3\n\
     1       a\n\
     2       b\n\
             c\n\
\n\
   Synopsis:\n\
\n\
     paste [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n\
\n\
   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *note Common\n\
options::.\n\
\n\
`-s'\n\
`--serial'\n\
     Paste the lines of one file at a time rather than one line from\n\
     each file.  Using the above example data:\n\
\n\
          $ paste -s num2 let3\n\
          1       2\n\
          a       b       c\n\
\n\
`-d DELIM-LIST'\n\
`--delimiters=DELIM-LIST'\n\
     Consecutively use the characters in DELIM-LIST instead of TAB to\n\
     separate merged lines.  When DELIM-LIST is exhausted, start again\n\
     at its beginning.  Using the above example data:\n\
\n\
          $ paste -d '%_' num2 let3 num2\n\
          1%a_1\n\
          2%b_2\n\
          %c_\n\
\n\
\n\
   An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value\n\
indicates failure.
